Seeing this breathing bio feedback app, as a customed meditation service for people to be able to self analyse their emotions through their breathing. Creating a toolkit to allow people to use a digital service to take a step back and relax in a comfortable matter. Encouraging people through sound and sight to personally gain a deeper understanding to the link between their breathing body biofeedback and emotional status. This app can be used at any stage or anytime, which gives the person a tool to help change their behaviour by understanding habits that occur during different breathing patterns.
